## Introduction

Hello and Welcome!

![](images/pav1.jpg)

My name is Pavithra Srinivasan and I am from Seattle, WA. I moved to New York to start the MS Epidemiology program at Columbia University. I went to undergrad at Baylor University, and then worked at a public health agency shortly after. My goal is to pursue higher degrees for both academic and professional growth. I love to dance, cook and go on hikes in my free time. Take a look around my website to learn more about me.
